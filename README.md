# Inference_on_compressive_measurements
Introduction to Compressed Sensing and CS-based inference.

The references to develop these codes are the followings:
1. `Sparsity_and_reconstruction.py` is based on [SparseRecovery](https://github.com/ekki25/SparseRecovery).
2. `Non_sparse_signals.py` is based on [Pyrunner](http://www.pyrunner.com/weblog/B/) and in [Gallamine's Scientific Computing Blog](http://www.gallamine.com/2014/02/a-brief-introduction-to-compressed.html).
3. `Image_reconstruction.py` uses code reported in [Pyrunner](http://www.pyrunner.com/weblog/B/).
4. `Detection.py`, `Classification.py`, `Estimation.py` and `Filtering.py` reproduce the results of [Signal Processing With Compressive Measurements](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5419058/).
5. `Detection_with_SVM.py` uses code provided in [Compressed Learning Using SVMs](https://github.com/pratyush1019/Compressed-Learning).
6. `Classification_with_DNN.py` implements a DNN for inference on compressed measurements based on the model proposed in [Direct inference on compressive measurements using convolutional neural networks](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7532691/).
